The metatest package fits meta regression models and computes various statistics to test the significance of the coefficients.

Changes in version 1.0-5
  o Added registration of S3 methods. 

Changes in version 1.0-4
  o Replaced calls to as.real (soon to be deprecated) by as.double. 

Changes in version 1.0-3
  o Fixed a bug in the degrees of freedom for the t-test (was n-1, now is 
		n-ncol(x), where x is the design matrix). Note that the Huizenga et al 
		paper also contains this error. 

Changes in version 1.0-2
  o Updated the reference to our paper which has appeared in the British 
    Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.

Changes in version 1.0-1

  o Fixed a bug in the p-value of the test of the significance of the 
    likelihood ratio test of the between studies variance which is by
    default divided by 2 (as per Berkhof & Snijders, 2001), which led to 
    odd results (ie p-value of 0.5) when the ratio is zero. This has now 
    been set to the value of 1.
