The metatest package fits meta regression models and computes various statistics to test the significance of the coefficients.

Changes in version 1.0-1

  o Fixed a bug in the p-value of the test of the significance of the 
    likelihood ratio test of the between studies variance which is by
    default divided by 2 (as perBerkhof & Snijders, 2001), which led to 
    odd results (ie p-value of 0.5) when the ratio is zero. This has now 
    been set to the value of 1.
